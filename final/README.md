# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

How to start and use this project:
Run with npm install to install all dependencies, npm run build and npm run start to use the project on the web.

Basic description of the project: A chat application that allows people to log in to chat using their usernames. LoggedIn users can send messages in the public chatting room and check there are who and how many active users in the chatting room.
The website will update itself every 5 seconds so that LoggedIn users can always see which user has logged in and logged out.
